            The desire to be respected by someone of the opposite sex is
            something that runs deep within everyone,even though most people
            don't take time to find someone who truly respects them.It seems
            like people are just looking for someone to show them the slightest
            amount of attention,settling for something much less than respect.I
            am convinced one of the best ways to help any relationship grow is
            by showing respect.

            I have come to conclusion that everyone long to be respected. What
            is respect? Respect is showing someone extra special attention, or
            high regard,based on a desire to show them how highly they are
            valued.
